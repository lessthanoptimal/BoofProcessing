# Boof Processing

Boof Processing is a wrapper around [BoofCV](http://boofcv.org) for the [Processing](https://processing.org/) environment.
It provides an  easier to use API and special functions for Processing.

# Requirements

To build the library you need the Java JDK, Gradle, and Processing 3 installed. Gradle will automatically download all the library
requirements.

To run the examples you will need to install the Video library. This is done through the usual means. In your sketchbook
select Sketch->"Import Library..." then search for "Video" and install it.

# Building

```bash
cd BoofProcessing
./gradlew processingZip
```

Then after a little bit boofcv_processing.zip should appear in the BoofProcessing directory. This can then be opened 
inside your "~/sketchbook/libraries" directory.

# Help Boof Processing!

Boof Processing is in a maintenance mode right now. Bugs will be fixed and rarely new features are reluctantly added.
It currently only supports a few of the features in BoofCV and to reach its full potential really needs someone who can
give it more attention and is more familiar with Processing.

So if you think you want to quickly add a new feature or fix a bug just fork the code and do it!  Just let me know
when you think the code is ready to be merged back in.
